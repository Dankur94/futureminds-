  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="date">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>Agreement</strong><br>
    By enrolling in a FutureMinds program, you agree to these terms. FutureMinds is operated by Space of Possibilities Limited (Hong Kong Reg. No. 79049548).</p>

    <p><strong>Enrollment & deposits</strong><br>
    A $500 HKD deposit is required to reserve a spot. The deposit is fully applied to the term fee. The remaining balance is due before the first session.</p>

    <p><strong>Money-back guarantee</strong><br>
    If you change your mind before the first session, your deposit will be refunded in full — no questions asked. Refunds are processed within 14 business days via the original payment method (FPS).</p>

    <p><strong>Cancellation</strong><br>
    After the first session, no refunds are available for remaining sessions. You may transfer your enrollment to another student with prior notice. If FutureMinds cancels a program (e.g. due to insufficient enrollment), all fees will be refunded in full.</p>

    <p><strong>Session delivery</strong><br>
    Sessions are delivered in-person in Hong Kong or online via video call, as selected at enrollment. Session schedules are communicated in advance. FutureMinds reserves the right to reschedule sessions with at least 48 hours notice.</p>

    <p><strong>Group size</strong><br>
    Classes have a maximum of 5 students to ensure quality instruction. Minimum enrollment of 3 students is required for a program to proceed.</p>

    <p><strong>Parental responsibility</strong><br>
    Parents/guardians are responsible for ensuring their child attends sessions on time. For in-person sessions, parents are responsible for drop-off and pick-up. FutureMinds is not responsible for supervision outside of scheduled session times.</p>

    <p><strong>Intellectual property</strong><br>
    Course materials (slides, handouts, project files) are provided for personal educational use only and may not be reproduced or distributed. Projects created by students remain the intellectual property of the student.</p>

    <p><strong>Liability</strong><br>
    FutureMinds takes reasonable care to ensure the safety of all participants. However, we are not liable for any injury, loss, or damage that occurs during sessions, except where caused by our negligence. For robotics sessions involving tools and electronic components, students will be supervised at all times.</p>

    <p><strong>Governing law</strong><br>
    These terms are governed by the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Any disputes will be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong.</p>
